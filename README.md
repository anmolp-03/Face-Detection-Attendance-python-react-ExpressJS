# Face Detection Attendance System (Python, React, ExpressJS)

A comprehensive, full-stack attendance management system leveraging face detection technology. Built using Python for backend face recognition, ExpressJS for robust API management, and React for an intuitive, responsive frontend. Designed for educational institutions and organizations to automate, secure, and streamline attendance tracking.

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anmolp-03/Face-Detection-Attendance-python-react-ExpressJS.git
   cd Face-Detection-Attendance-python-react-ExpressJS
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Create `.env` files in `backend/`, `server/`, and `client/` as needed
   - Set up database credentials and API keys

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt
   cd ../server && npm install
   cd ../client && npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Application**
   - **With Docker:**
     ```bash
     docker-compose up --build
     ```
   - **Manually:**
     - Start backend: `cd backend && python app.py`
     - Start server: `cd ../server && npm start`
     - Start frontend: `cd ../client && npm start`

## 📸 How It Works

- **User Registration:** Admin enrolls users with their facial data
- **Attendance Marking:** User stands before the camera; system detects and recognizes face
- **Verification:** Upon positive match, attendance is logged and confirmation displayed
- **Reporting:** Admins and users access attendance records via dashboard
